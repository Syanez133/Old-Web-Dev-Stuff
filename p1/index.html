             <strong>The International</strong> (TI) is an annual Dota 2 eSports tournament hosted by Valve Corporation, the game's developer. Sixteen teams are given invitations to compete in the tournament. The first tournament took place in Cologne, Germany at Gamescom in 2011 and was held shortly after the public reveal of Dota 2, with a total prize pot of  <span>$1.6 million</span>. The second International took place in 2012 at the Benaroya Hall in Seattle, and retained the same  <span>$1.6 million</span> prize structure. For the third International in 2013, again at Benaroya Hall, Valve introduced an interactive, digital "compendium" which fans could purchase to follow the event and contribute to the prize pool; which reached a  <span>$2.8 million</span> prize pool with  <span>$1.2 million</span> added from compendium purchases. The fourth International, this time held at the larger Seattle venue KeyArena in 2014, continued the practice of compendium sales and ultimately broke records for having one of the largest prize pool in eSports history, with a total of <span>$10.9 million</span>.
             The fifth International took place in 2015, with the prize pool totaling over  <span>$18 million</span>, making it the largest eSports prize pool for a single tournament until being surpassed by the sixth International the following year, with a prize pool of over <span>$20 million</span>.

            Free to Play is a 2014 documentary film by American video game company Valve Corporation. The film takes a critical look at the lives of Benedict "hyhy" Lim, Danil "Dendi" Ishutin and Clinton "Fear" Loomis, three professional Defense of the Ancients (DotA) players who participated in The International, the most lucrative eSports tournament at the time. The central focus of the film is how their commitment to DotA had affected their lives and how this debut tournament for the sequel, Dota 2, would bring more meaning to their struggles.

            I decided to link this movie for anyone that's interested so they can better understand how much it means to these players to be able to attend the international. It shows how dedicated these players are to the game and how hard they are willing to work to be able to play at such a high skill level.
